# Rhetorical Exploration of Presidential Debates

This is a final project for the spring 2016 Natural Language Processing class at Wellesley College by Marena Richardson, Shivali Chandra, and Brendan Caporaletti.

With election season close at hand weâ€™re all wondering which candidate will come out on top. Speeches, statements, and debates are all important in helping voters decide on a candidate. However, it is not always clear how what candidates say affects their success. Debates are always followed by tons of discussion and evaluation of the candidates including critic opinions, news articles, social media sentiment and polls. We want to analyze candidate debates in order to understand what makes or breaks a presidential candidate.

To that end, we created a set of clean debate transcript data from the raw text we found [here](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/debates.php). The modeling and analysis techniques we used to analyze the data are all described in great detail on our project site: [http://wellesleynlp.github.io/skchandra_marenar_bren525-finalproject/index.html](http://wellesleynlp.github.io/skchandra_marenar_bren525-finalproject/index.html)
